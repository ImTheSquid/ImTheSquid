# ðŸ“° The Board 
Hi! I'm Jack, and I love to code. This is my board where I'll occasionally post announcements regarding my projects.

## ðŸ‘‹ A Quick About Me
I'm currently studying CS, AI, and Mathematics at Purdue. 

My favorite laguages right now include:
- Rust
- Swift
- JS/TS
- Python

Find me on Discord @ImTheSquid#8897 or Twitter @ImTheSquid11

## ðŸ›  BD Plugins Update
Due to recent breaking changes to BetterDiscord and a lack of a good way to patch these plugins at the current moment, I will not be fixing any issues with them. Once infrastructure has been setup to deal with all that has changed, I will start fixing issues and bringing my plugins back to a working state.

## ðŸ’¬ AllujaMessages
Due to a [SwiftUI bug](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/712510), the `onMessagesChange` `proxy` argument can't be used to scroll to bottom on iOS 16 without a crash. Other versions of iOS work fine, and once this bug is resolved iOS 16 should work fine too.

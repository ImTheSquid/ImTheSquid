## ðŸ›  BD Plugins Update
With the release of BetterDiscord 1.8.0, I'm now working on updating my plugins to be compatible with Discord's new system. StickerSnatcher and SplitLargeFiles have been updated, and Tuxphones is currently in-progress; I will work on other plugins as soon as I have the time.

## ðŸ’¬ AllujaMessages
AllujaMessages has now been fixed for iOS 16 since version 1.0.4.
